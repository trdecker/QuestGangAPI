# Overview

We made a headless fantasy adventure game where the player can create a character, go on quests, and fight monsters. Characters can either be a Wizard, Rogue, or Barbarian. Users able to buy, equip, and sell items with in game gold such as weapons and armor. In quests, users choose what locations they will travel to, and how to fight the monsters they'll face. Killing a monster rewards the user with gold. Finishing a quest rewards the user with gold and levels up the user, which improves their stats, making them more powerful. Users can request more quests to go on, and can leave a quest they are in at anytime, as long as they are not in combat. Users can also view their character's stats and inventory at any time.

This game is entirely headless, meaning that it is playable without a frontend. Users can construct their own frontend to their liking to play the game, or can play using only using API calls. The backend contains all the game logic, so users should not be able to cheat by misusing the API.
